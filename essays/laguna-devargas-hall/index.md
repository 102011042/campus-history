Laguna DeVargas Hall (LDV) is one of the most distinctive and more classical residence halls at UNM. Having been built during the late 60s, construction for the dorm finished in 1969 and was praised for its unique and fresh design. Each suite accommodates up to six residents, providing a balance between privacy and community living. This suite-style design was introduced to provide a more modern and comfortable living space, with shared bathrooms and common areas that encourage social interaction. And depending on which room you get, you may even see a beautiful view of the Sandia Mountains standing proudly in the distance when on the 3rd floor!

Learning Communities (LLCs), including STEM and Fine Arts programs, helping students connect with peers who 

share their academic interests.

## About LDV's lead architect
{% include figure.html class="img-right" width="60%" caption="Mr. Ernest J. Kump. [Source](https://alchetron.com/Ernest-J-Kump)" src="images/ernest-j-kump-5071f3f4-9a13-4cce-8a25-63b9de414ff-resize-750.webp" %}

Mr. Ernest J. Kump was born on December 29th, 1911 and passed away on November 4th, 1999. Throughout his life, Mr. Kump had accomplished many great architect projects across America. He has even been considered by The American Institute of Architects as "a pioneer of modular practices and systems concepts in architecture." During the 1960s especially, Ernest J. Kump played a major role for UNM, giving the University the '"Ultra-Modern"' look. Resulting in buildings like Laguna DeVargas and how their
unique design helps give UNM a special place in the modern architect world.
