# Estufa

#### Introduction
The Estufa was built in 1908 by president William Tight and the boys of the Tri-Alpha fraternity. The Tri-Alphas would later become Pi Kappa Alpha, the first fraternity on UNM campus. Being a Pike, we all had to learn the history of the frat as well as the history of our own Beta Delta chapter here at UNM. The Estufa has been used for as long as the frat has been around for meetings as well as rituals, so the building is extremely meaningful. Which is also the reason why I chose to do my project on the Estufa.

#### Architecture
The Estufa is modeled after a kiva, it has thick adobe walls and contains a single windowless room with seating around the edges. Construction of the building was guided by university president William Tight, who promoted the use of Pueblo Revival architecture on campus. The Estufa was one of the first buildings in New Mexico to employ this style. It is also one of the oldest buildings on campus.

#### History
The building is used as the secret, or not-so-secret meeting place for Beta Delta Pikes. Many people know that the little building is where the Pikes gather, but not many know what the meaning and history behind it. Through its 100+ years of history, only a few hundred men have had the privilege and honor of entering the Estufa. Due to its secrecy, many have tried to break into the Estufa, members from rival fraternities like Sigma Chi have attempted to get in and some have succeeded in the past. During its long history as a fraternity council room, the Estufa has been involved in numerous pranks and has been broken into or vandalized many times, often by the rival Sigma Chi fraternity. However, the entrance to the Estufa is now a bank vault door to put an end to it once and for all. The building is accessible only to members of Pi Kappa Alpha, and no woman has ever seen its interior. 
The Estufa has survived both accidental and intentional vehicular collisions as well as "attempts to destroy it with fire, dynamite, water and other weapons" according to an Albuquerque Journal article from 1952. In 1947, the building was set on fire four times. It was also damaged by an accidental gas explosion in 1958 that left five people injured. In the 1960s, the building seemed doomed by a University Boulevard widening project, but city planners ultimately chose a road alignment further to the west that kept the Estufa safe. It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
