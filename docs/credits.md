This website is the result of a collaborative research project by dedicated, industrious, and creative students in a [Digital History course](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-history) in Spring 2019 offered through the [History Department](history.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu).
